      Job description The job was composed from 3 main items. Each of them
      equally important in order to deliver a good final product. First of all
      was the installing of fan coil Units. We received 2 types of Units (wall
      mount and ceiling mount). We were able to install them according to the
      design and secure them according to the method statement. Second, we
      install the plenum boxes and connect them to the fan coil units through
      proper tin round duct and isolated flexible duct. We secure the flexible
      duct with strangle bands and we give a nice final product with aluminum
      foil tape. Third and the last item was to install the flow bars
      accordingly with the slots and the schedule provided by the client. We
      aimed to set the flow bars perfectly in laser level and make it visually
      close to perfection for the final product. Gallery.
